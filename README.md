# 📁 About the project.<a name="about"></a>
This project was developed for help people to solve their problem and help their communities, creating an NGO (non-governamental organization) on the website and posting their cases there, so how will it work?
<br>
<br> 
First a person registers his NGO on the site and posts his case with a reward for the Hero who will complete it (web).
<br>
<br> 
Then a Hero will be able to see a list of cases available on the mobile app, then he can choose a case to participate and after he chooses one, he will contact the NGO by e-mail or by their WhatsApp number that was available(mobile).
<br>
<br> 
After that the hero and the NGO will discuss how they can help each other to solve the case :)
